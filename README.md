# TextyShare
With this Service you can share Texts in Form of Markdown anonymously. After saving the text will be saved into a JSON Document, which cannot be edited anymore.

This Project was intentionally coded for the Second Hackathon (formerly named PHP Jam) of the BlackScorp Discord Server. 

# Setup
1. Have PHP 7.4 or higher installed
2. Clone / Download this Repository
3. Run `composer update` in the Directory where Textyshare is located
4. Make sure the Webserver User has access to write into `/sharedContent/` Folder

# Credits 
For some things inside this project I have used following Composer Packages:
- michelf/php-markdown
- ezyang/htmlpurifier

Also thanks to Stackoverflow ;)
